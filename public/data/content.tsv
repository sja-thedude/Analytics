1	Justice Department Researcher Questions 0.3% THC Limit For Hemp, Saying Federal Law Based On 1950s Anecdote	The 0.3 percent THC threshold in the federal definition of hemp, aimed at preventing intoxication, lacks clear scientific basis according to a Justice Department researcher. A study found most hemp products exceed this limit, but they contain such minimal THC that getting high would require smoking an unfeasibly large joint. Legislative efforts are underway to amend hemp regulations, including proposals to raise the THC limit and address regulatory barriers for CBD products. Despite regulatory challenges, the hemp market remains robust, outpacing state marijuana markets and rivaling craft beer sales nationally in 2022.	article		https://www.marijuanamoment.net/justice-department-researcher-questions-0-3-thc-limit-for-hemp-saying-federal-law-based-on-1950s-anecdote/	1	1714286073
